# News Aggregator Project Summary

## Project Aim

The aim of this project is to create a sophisticated news aggregator platform that collects news from various sources, personalizes content for users, and provides an interactive news consumption experience. The platform will use a microservices architecture for scalability and flexibility.

## Key Features

- User account management
- Automated news collection
- Personalized news recommendations
- AI-powered conversations about news articles
- Real-time notifications
- Analytics for user behavior
- Fast, responsive front-end experience
- Powerful full-text search capabilities

## Service Breakdown

1. **API Gateway**
    - Acts as the single entry point for all client requests
    - Routes requests to appropriate microservices
2. **Authentication Service**
    - Manages user authentication and authorization
    - Generates and validates JWT tokens for secure access
3. **User Service**
    - Handles user account management
    - Stores and retrieves user profiles and preferences
4. **News Collection Service**
    - Automatically collects news articles from various sources
    - Categorizes and stores articles in the database
    - Uses Airflow for scheduling collection jobs
5. **Recommendation Service**
    - Generates personalized news recommendations for users
    - Utilizes user preferences and behavior data for accurate suggestions
6. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Service**
    - Enables AI-powered conversations about news articles using Langchain
    - Allows users to ask questions and get insights about news content
7. **Notification Service**
    - Sends real-time notifications to users
    - Alerts users about new articles, recommendations, and account activities

## Technology Stack

- Programming Languages: Python, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript
- Databases: PostgreSQL, Redis
- Message Brokers: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka
- Data Processing: Apache Airflow, Snowflake
- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes
- Frontend: Next.js (React framework)
- Search Engine: Elasticsearch
- Additional: JWT for authentication

This microservices architecture allows for scalability, flexibility, and easier maintenance of the news aggregator platform. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, enabling rapid feature development and efficient resource allocation. The inclusion of Next.js ensures a modern, efficient frontend, while Elasticsearch provides robust search capabilities essential for a news aggregation platform.
